## Prerequisites

* Linear Models
* Scientific Python (NumPy & SciPy)
* Calculus (Chain Rule, Partial Derivatives)
* Linear Algebra (Matrix Operations)

## Overview

In this workshop we will cover the fundamental theory and applications of **Neural Networks**.
We will derive the Bacpropagation Learning Algorithm and implement a network using `NumPy`,
exploiting computational graph theory.
The Neural Network approximator will be compared to a simple Linear Model on a binary classification application
for Computer Vision.

## Agenda

### Theory

> Neural Networks

### Applications

> Computer Vision: Binary Classification

### Codelab

> Neural Network from Scratch (`NumPy`)

#### Setup

##### macOS

1. Follow `Python` setup environment, according to `Docs` repocitory.
2. Run `source scripts/setup.sh` command.
